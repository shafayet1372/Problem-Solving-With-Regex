/* Alphabetically Sorted
A word is alphabetically sorted if all of the letters in it are in consecutive alphabetical order. Some examples of alphabetically sorted words: 
abhors (a is before b, b is before h, h is before o, etc.), ghost, accent, hoop.

Create a function that takes in a sentence as input and returns true if there is at least one alphabetically sorted word inside that has a minimum length of 3.

Examples
isAlphabeticallySorted("Paula has a French accent.") ➞ true
// "accent" is alphabetically sorted.

isAlphabeticallySorted("The biopsy returned negative results.") ➞ true
// "biopsy" is alphabetically sorted.

isAlphabeticallySorted("She sells sea shells by the sea shore.") ➞ false
// Although "by" is alphabetically sorted, it is only 2 letters long.
Notes
Do not count words with 2 or fewer characters.
Ignore punctuation (periods, commas, etc). */

function isAlphabeticallySorted(sentence) {
	return sentence.replace(/[^\w\s]/g,'').split(/\s/).some(x=>x.length>2 && x==x.split("").sort().join(""))
}

console.log(isAlphabeticallySorted("Paula has a French accent."))
